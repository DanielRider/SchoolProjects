Dumping some co-lab notebooks i've created over the past year
## ada002cluster
unstructured text data analysis using the openAI and scikitlearn libraries. Used t-sne for clustering, then used openAI API to label the clusters

## DeepFaceWC
used opencv and pre-trained models to do emotion analysis on our faces then saved the real time data to a mongoDB noSQL database

## Math Methods in Data Science HW2 and Final HW
The final Homework was implementing SVD clustering manually. First generating two N-dimensional gaussians distance d apart, first using a crude distance based clustering algorithm to determine which guassian produced which point. Then, using SVD/PCA dimension reduction as a clustering algorithm to improve results.

HW2 was generating a n-dimensional ball. Putting points on the surface of the ball. Then, determining how many points lie within an equator of width b.
